# hello-world

I'm Bri, a twenty-something trying to figure out life. 
I kind of stumbled into computer programming, and web development. 
It's fun but quite mind boggling to understand at times. 
I'm more of a creative type than a logical thinker, 
I like video games, story telling, and vivid imagery. However,
if I ever do get the hang of computer programming I would love to incorporate
that into my work.
